        <h3>My Career So Far</h3>
        <p>
          Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world.
          From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently, I lead UI/UX design at SaaS start-up VideoMyJob.
